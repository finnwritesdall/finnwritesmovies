    <title>Hundreds of Beavers (2022)</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/hundreds-of-beavers-2022/" />
    <updated>2025-04-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/hundreds-of-beavers-2022/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/tPoEiQnxGLjJ6uhiut8aTvuC0YH.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ryland Brickson Cole Tews and his nervous beaver lawyer in beaver court&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d been waiting to see Mike Cheslik’s magnum opus for about two years now, and heard it hyped up at festivals for twice as long. So, when I was finally able to see it with my own eyes — in a packed cinema no less — you bet I was excited. But was the praise warranted, and did I maybe have my hopes just a little too high? Luckily, it was just as good as they say. &lt;em&gt;Hundreds of Beavers&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just a love letter to Cartoons and silent-era slapstick, it’s a goddamned renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jean Kayak (Ryland Brickson Cole Tews) and his cider brewery go up in smoke thanks to some rogue beavers — their gnawing of the largest barrel culminating in a mass fire to his apple orchard and an explosion that heralds in an ice age for the surrounding wilderness — the young man is forced to survive a harsh and unforgiving winter. Having no success with his harebrained schemes to catch and stew a couple of rabbits, and his well endowed snowmen struggling to help him catch and fry any fish, he succumbs to the hunger and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not before being rescued just in nick of time. Picked up just in time by the jolly Master Fur Trapper (Wes Tank) and his sleigh of hounds, Jean accompanies the Christ(mas)-like figure to drop off his sack of animal pelts to his friend and patron, the grizzled Merchant (Doug Mancheski). And it’s there where Jean meets the prettiest woman alive, The Furrier (Olivia Graves). However, learning that her hand in marriage belongs to the Master fur Trapper, and that her father is loathsome and hard to please Merchant, Jean makes it his mission to become a Fur Trapper worthy of the old man’s praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/d26hVZhft7XCwkpVqZBoRSu20IR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ryland Brickson Cole Tews being chased down by the titular hundreds of beavers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film really is something you just have to see to believe it, but Cheslik goes above and beyond what you’d expect a live action rubber-hose cartoon to look like. The Merchant will squash a stretch his face with displeasure as he spits ink coloured tobacco toward a spittoon, only to miss it in increasingly comical ways each time. Era accurate lighting will obscure Jean’s face as he skulks around the beavers’ elaborate lair, and wide lensed close-ups exaggerate every characters’ already distinct features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to mention the wonderfully nostalgic sound design. Despite being a relatively silent film, special care is taken to give every character a unique voice. Crisply dubbed and bursting with energy, every shout, cry, swear and cheer adds a layer on top of the already expressive body language of its actors, to make even the most hardened critics chuckle. Combined with old school foley techniques and the Merrie Melodies of Chris Ryan, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds of Beavers&lt;/em&gt; is no doubt looney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also dances to its own tune, and with a score of other influences from video games to modern internet humour, it’s easy to see why. Because the film establishes itself as an expert of the form, it’s breaking away from tradition produces the most laughs. When the Furrier skins Jean’s first kill, the doting music, her lighthearted giggles and his swooning over her are all funny in their own right. But when blood splatters, organs squelch and A deflated raccoon’s plush innards spill out onto the table, it induces a slight shock in the audience. It’s Cheslik’s ability to escalate — escalate jokes, plot points and obstacles — that keeps feeling repetitive. It’s says something when a movies has more bits than beavers, and I still walked away wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VFX work, while simple is shockingly competent for this level of production. The green screening of people is not only clean but flawless. A manipulated leg here or there is nothing compared to the lack of haloing or artifacts that even multimillion dollar productions struggle to iron out. It’s film emulation is enough to fool even the most analogue filmmakers unless you know what to look for, and the aforementioned lighting is stunning to look at from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;Hundreds of Beavers&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to time, passion and commitment. Anyone willing to write about the patience it takes for a man to trap thousands of cunning animals certainly isn’t a director riding trends and hurrying out slop. In an age where studios are touting 300 million plus budgets while giving none of it to their rushed and tired VFX staff, and even channels like Corridor Digital, who have the talent and resources necessary to make incredible proof of concepts, but whose algorithm dictates quick two second google searches, one week turnarounds, and dabbling with AI, make the otherwise passionate team unable to think outside the bounds of a clickable thumbnail, it’s nice to see that Cheslik doesn’t just know his stuff — he lives and breathes it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cherry Falls (2000)</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/cherry-falls-2000/" />
    <updated>2025-03-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/cherry-falls-2000/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/b8KbYr4ssvlT2k1dLvJxcL55WOu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brittany Murphy bloodied after a rough night&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that killers target sex crazed teens. Ever since Jason was left unattended at a summer camp, psychos have hunted spatially-challenged horn-dogs like they were going extinct. But what if the opposite were true? What if a murderer targeted those yet to make a move; virgins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the killing of several of her classmates escalate tensions in the small town of Cherry Falls, Jody (Brittany Murphy) and her fellow students are left in a state of panic and confusion. But when her Dad, the overprotective Sheriff Brent (Michael Biehn, &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; ) along with the rest of the faculty discover the victims were all virgins before they died, they all scramble to do the nasty before their days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exes hook back up, nerds flex their comic book knowledge on shy wall flowers, and Dad’s ask their daughter’s if they’ve done “it” yet. This kind of pandemonium is played for laughs, and it’s hilarious, although just not in the way the film probably expects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From minute one, the attempt to latch onto the &lt;em&gt;Scream Franchise&lt;/em&gt; ’s success becomes pathetically apparent. Parents coming home before to see their child murdered, a principal murdered during the daytime, and even a kidnapped Dad and well meaning but suspicious law enforcement officer combined into one. It’s twist is a mishmash of Kevin Williamson’s original 1996 film and Alfred Hitchcock’s, so if you’ve seen either and were hoping for a nice surprise, you’ll have some idea who the culprit is before Jody’s even left the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a question of the film’s originality, as some of the best slashers were cutting and pasting what they liked from &lt;em&gt;Black Christmas&lt;/em&gt; to great effect. It’s more a question of what director, Geoffrey Wright didn’t do to elevate. As the greatest twist of this film is realising that &lt;em&gt;Metal Skin’s&lt;/em&gt; true-blue Aussie director made a bargain bin American slasher. And with it’s barely audible dialogue, complete with classroom echo and ruffled mics, it may have been a bargain to make, but it certainly is a ripoff to the ears. And with no subtitles on the official DVD, it just goes to show how much the distributor, much less the director cared about their “masterful” writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not all bad, in fact, it’s a fun time with mates because it’s bad. When it jumps discordantly to &lt;em&gt;Matrix-esque&lt;/em&gt; chase scenes and gaudy early naughties special effects, or cuts to it’s cheap wigs or rubbery props, you can’t help but feel giddy. And at the very least, Wright knows how to do some interesting set-pieces now and again. Like the real stunt driving at the climax of &lt;em&gt;Metal Skin,&lt;/em&gt; when the killer interrupts the high school orgy at the end of &lt;em&gt;Cherry Falls&lt;/em&gt; , a herd of half nude students clamber down the stairs to escape, only to stampede the poor female officer attempting to apprehend him, in what is one of the only kills I’ve seen in a slasher that doesn’t directly involve the main killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But besides those big moments, it doesn’t really have its own identity, and that’s made more insulting when more serious topics are turned into cartoonish spectacles to “shock”. Other horrors, even meta ones like &lt;em&gt;Scream,&lt;/em&gt; treat these traumas seriously. Sidney’s whole arc is predicated on the idea that while we get to home after the credits roll, Ghost-face’s actions with live with her and the rest of his surviving victims long after. Wright will often try to do something similar, but often mishandles or heightens the drama to the point of slapstick. He gets that horror is supposed to be a fun thrill, but often forgets why we confront those horrors on screen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did I have fun? Yeah absolutely. Do I think it’s a good film? Absolutely not. With the constant stream of slashers that I floating around there, I think it’s a interesting exercise into what producers mean when they say, “That’s great! But can you make it like this other thing?” A guilty pleasure for sure, but only with a buddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I’m watching movies, there’s always room for one more – ; ) .&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Annihilation (2018) – Going Where Novum Has Gone Before</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/annihilation-2018-going-where-novum-has-gone-before/" />
    <updated>2025-03-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/annihilation-2018-going-where-novum-has-gone-before/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/mrY8nJNnk9KFtn8NvWnHA8Gi1oI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tuva Novotny staring a mutant croc in the mouth&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Fiction has always been about exploring the outer reaches of our reality. And while space operas – with their many planets, diverse cultures and complex political struggles – provide an intriguing window into the future, their dominance in the genre has lead to a mess of nonsense names and information overload. While there are very few exceptions ( &lt;em&gt;The Dune Series and Original Star Wars Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; having creators who drew on real world societies or religions and stretched them to their logical conclusions) &lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it’s hard to distinguish any grey, brutalist, starship colony from one another. Pulp Sci-Fi gets around this problem by bringing space to our own backyard or specialising in a certain science. It does this through what’s called the “Novum”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novum, or “new thing” in Latin is the element in a science fiction story that changes everything. More precisely, it is the one changes that, as a consequence, changes everything else around it. For Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; (2016), it could be as simple as aliens coming to earth. Yet aliens have been a staple of Sci-Fi well before author Ted Chiang decided to put pen to paper. So his “new thing” is instead considered to be their language – one which destroys the very concept of past and present. For the far older &lt;em&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt; (1968), it was simple as, what if monkeys were sentient instead of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this narrowing of focus that allows the story to be engaging, as protagonists are often forced into discovering what makes the Novum tick, and as a consequence entice danger and leave the audience intrigued about how they’ll solve the mystery. H.G Wells was the master of this form of storytelling. His inventor from &lt;em&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/em&gt; and biologist from &lt;em&gt;The Island of Doctor Moreau&lt;/em&gt; are stricken mad by their adventures before the story even starts, but it only excites us more for what horrors await when they finally have the courage to recount their tales. This is because their discoveries of time travel and animal people are the one substantial change that creates every other consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New writers often struggle to create a believable Sci-Fi world because everything has to be “new”. New flying cars for new, modified people to drive to their new job as new testers for a new drug that makes you see a new virtual reality. Everything in their world has to have a seperate explanation for each new thing added, so their future becomes a tangled mess of generic ideas, because in an effort to unique, they struggle to balance all these new ideas in first drafts, leading to the next one being derivative so that its easier to keep track of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novum stories don’t have that problem because every future thing branches out from that one concept. Replicants in &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; are robots virtually identical to humans. That one sentence leaves behind questions: What are they used for? Who created them? Who repairs them? If they think and act like humans how do we tell them apart, and if so, can they feel like us too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer enough of these questions in a satisfying way, and you not only have a world, characters and gadgets, but their ramifications create a clear conflict within the story. As a result, they allow science fiction to be as simple or complex as the author desires – as long as it still has that central idea, people will not only follow along, but they’ll have a fun time doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still a feet to pull all this off successfully. Because despite what J.J Abrams’ might tell you, you still need to have answers that are not only satisfying enough, but also open enough to have audience members create their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think Alex Garland’s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; , and I assume Jeff VanderMeer’s original novel, is the pinnacle of a modern-day Novum story (or at least tied for first with &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/9trZvBr44UGedUOiGo3jgSUw13e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Natalie Portman staring down the tunnel to her doom?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meteor crashes into a lighthouse. Over the course of several months it emanates a oil coloured border around the surrounding area nicknamed “The Shimmer”. Designated as “The Southern Reach”, the American Government decides to study what this strange phenomenon is exactly. However, the personnel who enter disappearing, and the border soon encroaching onto to the mainland, the pursuit to discover quickly turns into an effort to destroy, as it’s existence could mean the end of life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first meet Lena (Natalie Portman), she’s already done the impossible and returned from The Shimmer alive. But surrounded by hazmat suited officials, we learn that she was the only one of her crew to make it. Her survival raises more questions than answers, and it’s only then that we learn what happened. After her husband and fellow army squad-mate, Kane (Oscar) reappears from a year long mission in which he was presumed to be dead, Lena is kidnapped by Area X, the government branch in charge of studying The Southern Reach, when Kane is rushed to the hospital for “radiation poisoning”. We may not know what The Shimmer is, but thanks to Garland and VanderMeer asking the right questions, we have the protagonist goal (find a way to save her husband from the effects of the shimmer), the antagonist (Area X and The Shimmer itself), as well as what awaits her if she fails (radiation sickness and the death of her and her husband).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes time for Lena and her crew to cross over to The Southern Reach, Garland borrows another of Well’s tools: the embedded narrative. When they discover an abandoned mess hall, Lena realises Kane was here before her. And when their leader, Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), finds an SD Card left behind by Kane and his own crew, everyone learns that the shimmer is not emitting radiation but is fundamentally changing the environment, animals and even people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lena’s interrogation may embed the film’s story, but Kane’s story is the second layer that foreshadows what will happen to Lena’s crew. This is only possible because The Shimmer blocks contact from the outside world and those who have a story to tell are trapped inside. All of this, mind you is links back to the one element: The Shimmer and it’s so-called radiation. Radiation is able to explain everything so far, the bodily destruction of cells, the shifting of DNA to create mutations, but what it doesn’t explain is what “the one thing” is, as we already have plenty of radiation on earth, and no mutation is rapid or severe enough to cause animals, plants and humans to merge. That’s why when astrophysicist Josie (Josie Radek) figures out what it actually is, the Novum also becomes a satisfying twist in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shimmer is refraction. Not just of light waves, but of everything, sound, time, cells and “all DNA”. It’s not radiation waves that are altering their DNA, but DNA itself refracting against its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see then why the simple notion of “what if everything could refract” spawns a million different possibilities and existential horrors. It still takes a genius to come up with questions and answers for everyone, but by focusing on one thing helps writers like Garland and Vandermere become curious and stretch their imaginations beyond what they thought was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, a Novum is powerful because it brings fiction writing down to an exact science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is 2021 and England is in it’s third lockdown during the pandemic. Sam Crane and Mark Oosterveen, two out-of-work theatre actors, spend their days together in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; playing slots, driving around Los Santos and gunning down innocent civilians. But the once fun and sprawling possibilities of the game have now turned into a mindless chore for Sam, whose recent responsibilities as a parent and husband have no patience for his unemployed arse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until he discovers the Vinewood Bowl, a vacant outdoor arena in the game. Inspired to work with Mark on a production of Shakespeare’s &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; entirely within the world of GTA, he puts on a test performance that goes about as well as you’d expect – horribly. But after Sam’s wife, documentary filmmaker Pinny Grylls, learns of her husband’s utterly insane idea, she decides to document the process, buying the game and screen recording her own character to form what we now know as &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Hamlet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the ACMI commissioned piece &lt;em&gt;The Grannies&lt;/em&gt; – where several artists tried to reach the out-of-bounds areas of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt; – Sam, Mark and Pinny create a project that’s marvellously novel. The documentary creates the kind of warm feeling that only a DIY project can. Dialogue is garbled through game chat and out of sync with character’s mouths; auditions are interrupted by sudden gunfire between audience members or the police rocking up from a performed punch. What’s most remarkable, is that both the documentary – as well as Sam and Mark’s version of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; – is done entirely within &lt;strong&gt;the vanilla game&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent anytime watching livestreams in the past decade you’ve no doubt heard of GTA Role Play (RP) – even if you’ve never played the game before. It’s essentially taking the immersion of an open world or sandbox like &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Garry’s Mod&lt;/em&gt; for all my Source fans out there) and applying the type of serious LARPing you’d see at a renaissance fair or DnD campaign. Players treat the world of Los Santos as the “real”; you go about your day as your character, and if you break the law, the police – usually fellow players or DMs – will arrest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this is done mainly on a modded instance on PC, with people who know what they’re signing up for and all on a privately owned server that can moderate and remove any undesirable griefers and stream-snipers. Sam and Mark not only play on console, but are often found rehearsing in public lobbies or matches where any number of people can show up to spoil the fun. So, the joy of the documentary becomes how exactly they are going to find players willing to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things don’t go well at first, with their first potential actor (Co3lho) speaking little to no english and leaving after Mark’s demo soliloquy. djphil is more promising, being a literary agent who’s always wanted to be in a production of &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; , but she soon finds herself unavailable when her nephew, whose account she was borrowing, moves away for work. Nevertheless, thanks to posting about their production on social media, complete with a chaotic in game trailer, they’re able to rally enough friends (Dipo), RP players (Nora) and even famous voice actors (Jen, Pharrah from &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; ) to form a troupe for the play. But who really stands out to the audience are the genuine &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; players who join the group. Passersby like ParTebMosMir comes to the audition in a gaudy alien outfit ready to mess around, but soon becomes engrossed once he observes the other performers. It’s not really the actual performances that get you, as anyone with a brain can figure out Mark thinks his soccer friend Dipo is right to play Hamlet. Instead, it’s those anonymous players who rally around the troupe that end up receiving the most love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple months, when the end of the pandemic seems like a possibility, Mark and Sam aren’t exactly surprised to learn that most of their cast can’t balance their “real” work with their life inside Los Santos. Their disappointment reaches an all time high, when Dipo, having been offered a job in a real production, can no longer play Hamlet. Sam begins to question why they’re continuing with the project when it’s eating up so much of their time. And while Mark admits he has nothing to go back to, he can’t help but wonder what this job is exactly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re stuck doing, this…What is it? Fake job, nonsense job? Whatever this is.” – Mark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these darker moments are no doubt resonant with many unemployed creatives still struggling after the pandemic &lt;em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;cough, cough&lt;/em&gt;),&lt;/em&gt; that’s unfortunately where the cracks in the production start to show. Naturally, no documentary is truly candid; no matter how low budget or intentional the director is. But when Mark opens up about his aunt’s funeral and how he has no more living relatives, or Pinny chews out Sam for missing her birthday for &lt;em&gt;GTA,&lt;/em&gt; it may feel dramatically powerful, but you can smell the theatricality of it all. It’s at least made better by the intentional cut here and there to NPC’s listening in to all the filmmakers’ dirty laundry over game chat – as it shows Sam, Mark and Pinny are at the very least self aware enough to be a bit tongue-in-cheek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all that ceases to matter entirely once the final performance kicks off. With old characters like ParTeb returning to watch, Mark acting as both narrator and tour guide, and all the mishaps that can happen on a blimp, boat or plane, happening – the excitement is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What little we get of the actual &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; speaks to how wonderful games can be for forging lifelong friendships and that even events that seem small in the beginning can create wonderful real world memories for those willing to join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Princess Bride (1987)</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/the-princess-bride-1987/" />
    <updated>2025-02-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/the-princess-bride-1987/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/9nmMncgn0u5u3z54Vl2k42oGDDo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Westley and Princess Buttercup silhouetted by a sunset&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In honour of today being my Mum’s 58th Birthday, I thought I would talk about one of her all time favourite films. The film permeated my entire childhood – one of our cats was even named Wes, naturally short for Westley, and while I was too young to remember most of the names of the other nine we had at the time, I’m pretty sure there was a Vizzini in their somewhere (as inconceivable as the whole thing might sound. Nowadays, we’ve made it a tradition to see it at the cinema whenever it’s been on, and as luck would have it, it’s on tonight of all nights. So, allow me to just gush about a film that has always had a place in my heart – at least for a few hundred words or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred Savage plays a child who’s been at home with a fever. He’s hasn’t quite recovered, but he’s well enough to play &lt;em&gt;Hardball&lt;/em&gt; (1985), and he plans to make a whole day of it. That is, until his grandpa, played by &lt;em&gt;Columbo’s&lt;/em&gt; Peter Falk, comes in to surprise him with a gift: a decrepit and leather-bound romance novel. The old man soon begins reading the story, but his grandson is immediately turned off by all the schmaltz. A peasant stablehand named Westley (Cary Ewels) and the Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright) fall in love. Westley decides to leave for the high seas in search of riches and parting tragically, the lovers seal their passion with a kiss. It’s enough to make the grandson ill again, but when his grandfather tells him of Westley’s death and the hands of Dread Pirate Roberts and Buttercup’s kidnapping by the short-tempered and shrewd Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his band of goons, the boy is hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest thing about &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt; is it’s ability to straddle the line between parody and earnestness. It may have a cast of comedic actors, six fingered men and rodents of unusual size, but the expertly choreographed swordplay, characters with deeper motivations and backstories, and moments of genuine suspense – like Buttercup and Westley sinking in quicksand in the Fire Swamp – suggest a grander fairytale. The parody elements then become the grandfather’s flourishes as an unreliable narrator. As he skims a page here and skips a page there, the story no longer becomes about “twue lahv” but the power of stories themselves, and the loved ones who help create our wildest dreams. The everyday storytellers who orate their own abridged tales for our benefit, the ones who craft the memories we’ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Goldman, the screenwriter and author of the original novel, was having special difficulty outlining Westley’s lowest moment, him being strapped to the Torture Machine, and didn’t quite know how to get him out of it. He was racking his brain trying to come up with a solution, until unconsciously, he wrote down two words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Westley dies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing those words, so concrete on the page, made him cry. Like a grieving parent, Goldman could longer live in denial about what was to happen to Westley. He may have found a way to revive Westley later on, but in that moment, like Savage’s grandson, he was left distraught at the unfairness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Prince Humperdinck’s casual remarks prior about needing to miss the whole affair add a deliciously evil layer to the whole thing that’s hard not to laugh at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work, but I’ve got my country’s 500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder and Gilda to frame for it. I’m swamped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also delivered with such coolness by Chris Sarandon that it’s unnerving at the same time. The film arguably has as much staying power as it does because it loves the genre of medieval romance almost as much as it has fun laughing at its many, many tropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In era where everything needs to be lampshaded or dripping in irony for people to be comfortable laughing at it, &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt; brings comedy back to a place of love and wonder and one that takes no joy in cruelly mocking its characters. Inigo Montoya for example, may be casually ribbed for his repeated practicing of how he will introduce himself to his father’s killer, but by the end, the words, “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!” Becomes the battle cry of a man fighting through death to enact his greatest purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fitting twist for the film’s production, Director Rob Reiner was given a copy of Goldman’s novel by his father when he was growing up. In a sense, the creation of the film is a love story in itself. Rob’s love for the material, and Goldman’s love for the story that brought his daughters so much joy, brought the two artists in a way neither expected. With the 1973 screenplay being shopped around as the stuff of legends (with names like Truffeau or Robert Redford previously attached to direct), the young “upstart” Reiner was the only one who was able to understand Goldman’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…But that’s a whole other story, and I can tell you seem annoyed. You want me to stop? Yes? &lt;em&gt;As you wish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wD2Bp9RIF36EfsHiVqPNLq1SEOI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Westley defending his princess after exiting The Fireswamp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Se7en (1995) – Wading Through Apathy</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/se7en-1995-wading-through-apathy/" />
    <updated>2025-02-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/se7en-1995-wading-through-apathy/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/dYjZ27hDw2QFaEIfzbNGwW0IkV9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman coming to terms with their &#39;killer&#39; ending&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;/em&gt; was one of those Fincher Films I hadn’t seen until sometime last year. Mostly due to the fact that, like most YouTube addicted kids in the mid 2010’s, I’d absorbed the plot – as well as the infamous twist – through countless top ten videos. Mills has his Cliff Notes for &lt;em&gt;Dante’s Inferno,&lt;/em&gt; while I have my WatchMojo Top Tens for &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Se7en.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, knowing everything going in did taint my first watch, as I found it frustrating that, for a detective film, the brash David Mills and older, wiser Somerset were always offended by each other even when they earnestly started to work together. On the surface, they seemed to show little to no growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else about the film was wonderful: The forever rainy city, the gruesome crime scenes and disgraced actor Kevin Spacey’s unsettling performance were all top tier. Yet, the pain point of the film’s central relationship was forever in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, naturally I was a bit hesitant to see it at the Astor last Thursday, but it felt silly to miss out on a thirty year anniversary screening – especially with the promise of a 35mm print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it should surprise no one that having sat with the film for almost a year, and seeing it up on the big screen, something finally clicked up their in the front row balcony. The only thing feeling silly by the end of the film was me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot has the usual hard boiled trappings of a detective noir: Somerset is on the verge of retiring from the homicide unit when he uncovers a series of murders connected to the Seven Deadly Sins. Hardened enough to know when to quit, he refuses the case, but when his younger partner, the out-of-town Detective Mills, gets assigned it instead, he decides to work alongside him in an effort to protect the young man from the horrors this case has in store for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what’s special about &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;/em&gt; is Fincher’s use of the commonplace setting: the unforgiving, seeing it as a tool. He explores how our characters might go about communicating in a world that has taught them to remain distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerset is hated by his colleagues and put up with by friends for always caring about what happens after a case. What will happen to the orphan of murdered parents? Who are these people we’re looking at like bags of meat, what are their names, what did they do? Years of this has finally worn him down. His retirement is a means of escape, a refuge from “a place that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it were a virtue.” He’s stopped trying to help a city that keeps refusing to be saved; and if saving himself is the consolation prize, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something changes when Mills enters the picture. He may be an experienced homicide detective for someone so young, but his rural cases are nothing compared to ravenous creeps of the big city. Somerset, faced with the possibility that Mills might be chewed up and spit back out as a carbon copy of himself, feels the need to help his partner. A paternal instinct kicks in for the old man: if he can’t save the city, he’ll at least save his partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/ejcYNEKc0C59dqNBH9CtJ0WXNd1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman bonding over evidence&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like most father’s, Somerset has a hard time showing his appreciation for Mills. “It’s easier to beat a child than it is to raise it.” he says to Mills over drinks. And while Somerset doesn’t accost Mills, he certainly berates and belittles him for having a short-temper and being a bit too eager to cause a fuss. But, eventually some of his old kindness shines through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library scene, which I once derided for making Mills’ involvement in the case fairly minimal, is powerful in it’s subtlety. Somerset uses small gestures, like his envelope of research for Mills or his insistence to hear the testimony of the nightclub hostage while sticking Mills with interrogating the owner, as a form of showing love or appreciation for his young partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, Mills’ own constant chatter at crime scenes and his desperation to be a part of the investigations is his confused and often crude way of getting Somerset to open up more. The constant arguing, that feels like stagnant character development on a first watch, is Fincher’s way of showcasing the love languages of two people immersed in a city that has forgotten how to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Doe meanwhile, is the killer that represents everything wrong with the city. If Somerset’s apathy makes him want to run away from problem and Mill’s makes him want to fight to clean it up, regardless of what people think, John’s apathy makes him want to destroy it. John sees sin in every man, woman and child. He will throw up on a man who speaks about the weather, only to laugh at his annoyance. His role as religious disciple is fitting, as he conduct his “work” with the same dispassionate judgement his creator passes onto him and all the other creatures who exist within the city walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Somerset and Mills pick up pieces of the puzzle left by John, the serial killer gains a vested interest in the pair for entirely different reasons. He finds Somerset equal in intellect, but his already defeated attitude inspires none of his sadistic tendencies. However, Mills is yet to be broken. Their is a hopeful spirit left in him yet to humble. So, his “surprise” is not shocking for it’s grotesqueness, it’s shocking because it was planned, right down to the second, despite knowing nothing of other people’s feelings, John knows exactly what buttons to push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do I still feel hopeful after the ending of &lt;em&gt;Se7en&lt;/em&gt;? Why does it make me hopeful for our own future despite the horrors that lie ahead? Because while, someone like Mills may break, his ideals live on in the reformed Somerset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You think you’re quitting because you believe these things you say,” he responds to Somerset in the bar, “I don’t. I think you wanna believe ‘em because you’re quitting. You want me to agree with you…but I won’t say that. I don’t agree with you. I do not. I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of hardship, it’s much easier to run away from or to join in on the misery, but we must fight it, even if it doesn’t make a difference, because someday, to somebody it will!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What&#39;s the Rush? – Peter Weir and Sitting in the Moment.</title>
    <link href="https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/whats-the-rush-peter-weir-and-sitting-in-the-moment/" />
    <updated>2025-02-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://finnwritesmovies.com/posts/whats-the-rush-peter-weir-and-sitting-in-the-moment/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/h1BOZ76ITbZtXlQ6sndaek8rQjg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The boys of Dead Poets Society hanging out in their cave&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Weir has always been a rather strange director in the Australian canon. He’s a household name, but no one’s quite sure what for? He’s the type of artist whose filmography elicits surprised utterances of, “He made that!?” or “The Cars That Ate what?” But that’s arguably what makes him a talented director, his ability to blend his essence into seemingly anything. At first, you might wonder what an Australian is doing making a film about an American Prep School, yet look a little closer in Dead Poets Society (1989), and you’ll see the Australian Private School experience, complete with Chapel, enigmatic English Teachers, and bagpipes wheezing “Scotland the Brave” every hour on the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how far he strays from our little isolated continent, he always finds a way to take a little piece of home with him on the journey. But what’s that little spark that permeates all of his films? What makes a Weir film a Weir film?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing &lt;em&gt;Dead Poets&lt;/em&gt; with Finn, (a friend who happens to share the same name, and not me excusing going to the movies alone) at ACMI, I couldn’t help but comment on how disjointed every one of Weir’s films felt. He has that eye that all great Aussie directors have (Samuel sitting in that field of flowers at the end of &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt; (1985) comes to mind) but has that same penchant for meandering in a fairly decent premise, that to most writers, seems rather wasteful. Finn argued that sitting with his characters, like when we hang out in the cave with the boys of Welton Academy as they idly chat, allows us as audiences members to develop a greater investment in the boys when things eventually start moving along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/41Mlaj6wfjlF4wQaVH0tjfDXvMi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The girls chilling at Hanging Rock&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense, as another filmmaker might cut away far too quickly for the sake of plot, leaving us wondering if we even knew any of these boys at all. Weir’s storytelling may not be his strong suit, but my God does he have a unique. Everyone of his films carries this much darker undercurrent. That accent of Australian Gothic in &lt;em&gt;Picnic at Hanging Rock&lt;/em&gt; (1975) – warbling analogue synths, oppressive yet heavenly camerawork, and actors seemingly possessed by some otherworldly force – can be found everywhere in his work. Neil’s late night foray as Puck in &lt;em&gt;Dead Poets&lt;/em&gt; will forever be seared into my memory, and the people of Paris and their obsession with road “accidents” were comically frightful. It’s why I can never come away hating one of his films, their is always an image to latch onto, a painting which inspires in me an almost religious fervour that’s difficult to stifle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/bRRxELS8dK3cpqFhaTQcIENAPOI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Truman finding the sun in the palm of his hand&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why &lt;em&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/em&gt; (1998) is, in my opinion, not only his best film, but the culmination of his greatest qualities as a director. Jim Carrey’s Truman is watched around the clock. Were constantly made aware of the edges of a camera lens as we follow him around the manmade town of Seahaven. We sit behind the newsagent’s desk as he gets the morning paper, we observe him through his car’s steering wheel as he listens to the radio. When Truman snaps, its understandable, but when he begins to hold his supposed wife Meryl hostage, he’s filmed like a psychotic spouse ready to kill. First person shots, dutch angles and hysterics, we see a broken and dangerous man. But what’s far more horrifying is how dismissive director Christof and the rest of the crew are to Truman’s wellbeing, thinking nothing of the time they traumatised him by “killing” his father during a boating accident so that he would not only blame himself, but fear travelling by sea to try and escape the studio. The premise of a round the clock live TV Show suits Weirs ability to sit in a scene, as Truman’s daily routine is filled with seemingly innocuous activities. But thanks to Screenwriter Andrew Niccol, whose world building is always fleshed out, if a little blunt on themes. There’s now an underlying pace to everything. Niccol creates the little hiccups in The Truman Show’s production that start to unravel Truman’s mind. Meanwhile, Weir uses his experience as a director to inform the central theme: a controlling relationship between a creator and his creation only leads to disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/yrVtvlL4X3YrBF2VWMh5jN55XCS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Truman giving one last bow before heading out into the unknown&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Weir is not a storyteller but a painter. A man concerned more with Film as a form of enlightenment for others than a means of personal catharsis for himself. And while his plots aren’t always the most exciting, his portraits of people and places are wonderfully detailed. His works may not be remembered as solely his, but his art speaks to future filmmakers and creators. Like the spectres of dead poets, each one reaches out to all the artists inside of us and says simply this: “Seize the day!”&lt;/p&gt;
